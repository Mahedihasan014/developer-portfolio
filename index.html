                After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I learn?”
                After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web
                developer positions asked for, which was:
                JavaScript
                HTML & CSS
                CSS Preprocessors (Less & Sass)
                Responsive Design
                AngularJS
                Design Patterns
                Git
                NodeJS
                Task Runners

                <p>
                    A full stack developer is someone who works with both the front end and back end of a web
                    application.
                    The front end is responsible for the visual look and feel of the website, while back end is
                    responsible
                    for the behind the scenes logic and infrastructure of the site.

                    Are you a noob in all the fields of CS and want fast results with less studying? I was the same a
                    few
                    months ago and honestly, the beginning results in web development were astounding. I have painfully
                    come
                    to the realization that development is not confined to just showing beautiful things on a browser.
                    It
                    also involves the painstaking process of writing code that links innumerable pages and styles and
                    most
                    of the times, none of it works together. This is where the part about the frustration begins and
                    this
                    blog is about countering this so that your learning process is not hindered. We will see you through
                    to
                    the end.
